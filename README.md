# Motion Control of Redundant Robots with Generalized Hard Inequality Constraints
Repository for the implementation of motion control algorithms for kinematically redundant robots under generalized hard inequality constraints. 

## Description
The algorithms presented in this repository offer efficient solutions for addressing redundancy resolution in velocity and acceleration commands while considering joint and Cartesian inequality constraints simultaneously. They provide real-time constraint customization without the need for parameter tuning. These algorithms are generalized versions of the Saturation in the Null Space (SNS) method, incorporating both joint and task-space constraints.

A significant advantage of these algorithms is their faster run-time execution compared to state-of-the-art local Quadratic Programming (QP) solvers. This feature is particularly beneficial for real-time applications involving redundant robots.

Simulation results are included in this repository to demonstrate the effectiveness of these algorithms across different robotic systems. 

## Getting Started
The codes in this repository are written in MATLAB. To get started:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the downloaded repository folder.
3. Run the [`Example_Vel_Planar_6DOF_Robot.m`](Example_Vel_Planar_6DOF_Robot.m) script to execute the example for a planar 6-degree-of-freedom robot at velocity-level control.

## Todo
- [x] Add the algorithms for Velocity-level control.
- [ ] Add the algorithms for acceleration-level control.
- [ ] Add more simulation examples with different robot models.
- [ ] Add Python scripts.
- [ ] Enhance documentation for better code understanding.
